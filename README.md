<b>Step 1:</b>
Obtain the dataset from - https://sites.google.com/view/dataminingcompetition2019/dataset?authuser=0
Copy all data files into the TrainingData folder

<b>Step 2:</b>
Run DataScraping to generate all features

<b>Step 3:</b>
Use ModelBuildingAndPrediction to train the model, generate predictions, and evaluate them against the hidden evaluation data in the EvaluationData folder

<b>Disclaimer:</b> This code was built over a series of months for academic research. There may be small bugs, there are probably inefficiencies, and there are most certainly some places where more comments are needed. I was simultaneously teaching myself data science and working on this project. Any and all feedback/constructive criticism is welcome...but please be kind.
