Step 1:
Obtain the dataset from - https://sites.google.com/view/dataminingcompetition2019/dataset?authuser=0
Copy all data files into the TrainingData folder

Step 2:
Run DataScraping to generate all features

Step 3:
Use ModelBuildingAndPrediction to train the model, generate predictions, and evaluate them against the hidden evaluation data in the EvaluationData folder

Disclaimer: This code was built over a series of months for academic research. There may be small bugs and there are most certainly ineffeciences. I was simultaneously teaching myself data science and working on this project. Any and all feedback/constructive criticism is welcome...but please be kind.
